## Installation

### Front End 

This is a **React-Native** Application, made with the help of the *expo* framework.

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Installation is done using `npm install`

```console
$ cd front-end
$ npm install
```

To run the expo app use 

```console
$ npx expo start
```

The above command will start an expo server through which we can connect to our visionary glucose app from a mobile phone.

This app is also available in `APK` format. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1quB_Ji6U5I0M4RKZQFJt5WI2Uf5_jEFs/view?usp=drive_link).
